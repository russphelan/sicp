In an applicative-order evaluator, the arguments will be evaluated
first. This means that (p) will result in an infinite loop, since it
is evaluated to itself. 

In a normal-order evaluator, the test procedure will be applied first,
and since x does equal 0, will result in 0 without (p) ever being
evaluated. This reminds me of the 'lazy' evaluation that Michael
always talks about.
