sqrt procedure fails for very small numbers, eg. (sqrt .0001) =
.03230, should = .01. Also fails for very large numbers, eg. (sqrt
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) never returns. 

This happens in the case of small numbers because our starting guess
is less than the tolerance, .001. The difference between the square of
the guess and the original formal parameter is easily less than the
tolerance. 

In the case of large numbers, the precision of floating point
arithmetic comes into play. The large numbers cause an overflow, and
improvements to the guess aren't large enough to make a representable
difference. Thus, the function recurses infinitely.
